# GAT150 ‚Äì Introduction to Game Programming

**Course**: GAT150 ‚Äì Introduction to Game Programming (Summer 2025, Sprint Two)  
**Repository**: Builds upon the engine completed in CSC196 (C++ Programming II).

---

## üìñ Description

GAT150 is both a lightweight game engine and a simple platformer demo, created as part of the **GAT150 course**.  

It demonstrates key game programming concepts such as rendering, input handling, physics, and entity management. The engine is built in **C++** with support from modern libraries like **SDL3** and **Box2D**, making it a strong foundation for further projects.
